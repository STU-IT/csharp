# C# Exercises

Each subdirectory in this repository is an exercise.

Each exercise consists of a README.md and some automated tests.

Follow these instructions on how to [get your C# development environment set up][csharp-installation].

The exercises use NUnit. Follow [this guide][nunit-guide] to get started.

  **nucleotide-count**
  Given a DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

  **accumulate**
